# CSCI468-Work
This repository is a portfolio for potential employers to access of all of the work I have completed for CSCI 468, Introduction to Cryptography. All of the assignments have been published AFTER their due date.

ALL of the code published in this repository is in an altered state. Portions of code and assignment details may be altered and/or deleted entirely to prevent from future cheating and/or misuse of the code.

This class is NOT a code heavy course. Any code written for this class it to aide in the UNDERSTANDING of HW problems or to check ones work after completion. 

There will be no REAL answers to assignments provided in this repository, only the tools that were used/created to aide in classwork completion. Code functionality and what it was used for in the course will be provided in the subdirectory's README file. 

Additional information about problems/analysis completed can be obtained upon request. 

I, the code author and contributor of this repository, am the sole owner of all code published here (unless otherwise stated and created). All code published here is for PORTFOLIO USE ONLY. I, the contributor, am not responsible for any misuse of published materials
